# ChildMortalityInformationSystem (CMIS)
## Predicts the trends in Global Child Mortality Rates and display on the CMIS dashboard.


With the rise in infectious and burden diseases, child mortality has become an important factor for United Nations and healthcare bodies.
Furthermore, the increase in global infections due to the novel COVID-19 outbreak and other prior epidemics, such as HIV/AIDS, 
have disrupted the quality-of-life index across countries.
Ignoring these healthcare disruptions could reverse decades of improvements, and hundreds of thousands of children under-5 could lose their lives.
The study summarizes trends in child mortality rates and reports on progress towards the health and health - related Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs) and associated targets.


### This project focuses on the following Indexes to predict the Child Mortality Rates for different nations:
        i. Gross Domestic Product
       ii. Life Expectancy Rate
      iii. Healthcare Expenditure Index
       iv. Education Index
        v. Average Female Education Rate


The overall study scopes different factors such as gross domestic product, life expectancy rate, healthcare expenditure index, 
education index and average female education years across countries with highest child mortality rates. It measures whether above factors have 
positive, negative, or neutral correlation with the mortality rates? 
The mortality rate is calculated on the basis of deaths for HIV/AIDS, diarrhea, pertussis, measles, meningitis/encephalitis, malaria, 
acute lower respiratory infections, prematurity, birth asphyxia and birth trauma, sepsis, injuries and other noncommunicable diseases. 
The specific age group considered for the analysis resides between 0-5 Years of the cases, inclusive of 0-27 days and 1-59 months of data. 
Above factors are determined for these specific countries and regression models are applied to provide the predictive analysis of child mortality 
(in terms of deaths) for the target variables.
